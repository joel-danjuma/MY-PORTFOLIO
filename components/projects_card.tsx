            Hey there! Im a software developer with a passion for all things
            code. With 3 years of experience under my belt, Ive tinkered with
            Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Next.js, and FastAPI, crafting web
            wonders along the way. Ive also dabbled in a bit of Solidity and
            Hardhat, conjuring up smart contracts like a digital wizard. When Im
            not building code, you can find me working with words, creating
            engaging stories for my Medium blog. From tech tutorials to
            economics articles, I love sharing my learnings with fellow
            developers and curious minds. So, let us connect, grab a virtual cup
            of coffee, and dive into the fun side of software development
            together!
